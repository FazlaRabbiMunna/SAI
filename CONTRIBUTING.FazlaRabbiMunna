## Translations
Please don't create pull requests for translations, instead, use [SAI's Crowdin](https://polychromaticfox.crowdin.com/split-apks-installer). Shoot me a message there to add a new language to target languages.

## Reporting bugs
[Open an issue](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI/issues/new?labels=bug) and describe the bug including steps to reproduce it.

Please don't report installer errors as bugs unless you're fairly sure it is a bug, because most of those are actual device/ROM/archive related errors and not bugs.

## Suggesting features
[Open an issue](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI/issues/new?labels=enhancement) describing the feature you want and your reasoning for it.

## Code
Fork SAI's repo, include your changes and create a pull request.

Please consider the following:
- You should describe what your changes do in the pull request description.
- SAI uses MVVM architecture (well, for the most part), so, make sure your code works with it.
- You should format your code with Android Studio's reformat code feature with only the "Optimize imports" options checked before committing it.
